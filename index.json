I uncover that earnings growth slows around age 30, after which job changes are increasingly less about higher pay. Using voluntary job transitions, I establish a preference ranking over firms and use it to estimate the role of systematic non-pay benefits, or 'amenities', in career moves. This study offers a fresh perspective on labor economics, emphasizing the importance of non-monetary factors in our career decisions.","tags":null,"title":"Amenities and Job Mobility over the Life Cycle","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1662422400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1662422400,"objectID":"3b77c1059dfca57599b604430b1bdc9c","permalink":"https://simonzuzek.github.io/project/optimal_shorttimework/","publishdate":"2022-09-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/optimal_shorttimework/","section":"project","summary":"Short-time work - a job retention subsidy conditional on hour reductions - has become an important policy tool despite a lack of agreement on which market failures it addresses. To fill the gap, we use Optimal-control theory to develop a model of job retention policies in the presence of asymmetric information. When individual productivity shocks are not observable, short-time work helps to target subsidies towards jobs at risk.
